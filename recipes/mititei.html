    <h2>These are small, skinless sausages that are often eaten during festivities
    or at picnics. It contains a variety of spices, meats, and seasonings.</h2>
    <hr class="line-separator">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ground Beef: 2.2 Ib (1 kg)</li>
      <li>Ground Pork or Lamb: 1 Ib.</li>
      <li>Ground Beef Suet: 1/2 Ib.</li>
      <li>Garlic Head, minced: 1</li>
      <li>Salt: 1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>Ground Black Pepper: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Dried Summer Savory OR Thyme: 1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>Ground Allspice: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Ground Anise: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Ground Coriander Seed: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Beef Broth OR Plain Water: 1 1/2 cups</li>
      <li>Baking Soda: 1 teaspoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dissolve baking soda in the beef broth or plain water. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Use a garlic press to crush the garlic cloves.</li>
      <li>Place the meat with all ingredients in a large bowl, including the garlic,
           and mix thoroughly (If you have a stand mixer, this will work too).</li>
      <li>Add the broth in stages, mixing well after each addition (The meat mixture needs
     to get to a smooth consistency, like a paste, but not too loose). You might not
      need to use all the broth/water.</li>
      <li>Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight for the meat to absorb the flavors.</li>
      <li>The next day, line a tray with foil and set it aside.</li>
      <li>Take the meat out of the refrigerator and, with wet hands, form the “Mititei”
           in a cylinder shape 2-3 inches long and 1 inch thick.</li>
      <li>Place them on the tray. Continue until you finish all the meat.</li>
      <li>Grill them on high heat, preferably on coal, not gas. Flip them to cook
           on both sides and cook them to your desired doneness (around 8 minutes).</li>
      <li>They are delicious when done with just a little pink inside and very juicy.</li>
      <li>Serve with mustard, fresh bread, or French fries next to a cold beer.</li>
      <p>Note: The “Mititei” meat should contain a pretty good amount of fat. The
           original recipes use beef suet, fat pork meat(usually shoulder), or lamb.
            You can use only beef, but you will need to add oil to the mixture to
             replace the fat. If you do not use fat, the Mititei will be dry.</p>
      <p>Note: Baking soda is mandatory!</p>
