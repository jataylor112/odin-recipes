    <h2>This dessert was first crafted in 1847 by a Parisian backery in honor of the
       French patron saint, Saint Honoré. It's a complex cake that uses a combination
     of choux pastry, puff pastry, Chiboust cream, and caramelized sugar. Although not
     the typical French food known to tourists, it's a delicious dessert enjoyed by many
     Frenchmen!</h2>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the base of the cake by combining all the ingredients into a smooth
         dough. Keep the dough in the refrigerator and continue with the making of
         choux paste.</li>
      <li>In a pan, heat water, butter, caster sugar, and a pinch of salt until
         boiling at which point immediately incorporate the flour, stir, and remove
          from heat.</li>
      <li>When the dough is formed into a ball, leave to cool and with a beater
        incorporate one by one four beaten eggs.</li>
      <li>On a buttered baking tray place the rolled out dough for the base, a circle
         20 cm in diameter and 3 mm thick. Prick the dough base with a fork and with
          a beaten egg brush the edge.</li>
      <li>Transfer a third of the choux paste into a piping bag with a smooth tip the
         width of a finger, then pipe a border 3 mm from the edge of the base. Brush
          the border with a beaten egg.</li>
      <li>With the remaining choux paste using a piping bag and on a buttered tray
        pipe 20 choux balls the size of walnuts. Bake the base and the choux balls in
        an oven preheated at 200°C for approximately 25 minutes. When done, leave to
        completely cool.</li>
      <li>For the caramel sauce cook the sugar and water until they reach 145 °C.
        When still hot dip the choux balls into the caramel, stick them caramel side
         down on the border making sure they touch each other.</li>
      <li>The last is the Chiboust cream filling. In a separate bowl soften the
        gelatin in 5 tablespoons of cold water. Beat egg yolks with caster sugar until
         white and thick and add the cornstarch.</li>
      <li>Boil milk together with a vanilla pod, remove the pod and pour the milk
        over the egg yolk mixture. Return everything to a pan, bring to a boil while
         all the time whisking.</li>
      <li>Incorporate the softened gelatin until completely dissolved. Bring the
        cream once more to a boil and pour over the egg whites that you’ve previously
        stiffly whisked. Fold in the whites and cream with a metal spoon and leave to
        cool until on the point of setting.</li>
      <li>Fill the center of the cake with cream, sprinkle with icing sugar and broil
         shortly until golden. Until ready to serve, keep in a cool place.</li>
