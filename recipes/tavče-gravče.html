    <h3>A national dish of North Macedonia, it's a standard meal on Fridays where
    most of the population adheres to Orthodox Christianity; thus, this meal contains
    no meat and works wells for vegans too! Instead of using meat, white kidney
    beans are backed on a Tava (or flat skillet) and mixed with other vegetables</h3>
    <hr class="line-separator">
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Beans, washed and cleaned: 4 cups</li>
      <li>Sunflower Oil: 5 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Dried Chili Peppers: 3</li>
      <li>Red Pepper (Paprika): 3 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Medium-sized Onions, sliced into quarters: 2</li>
      <li>Tomato Sauce: 2 cups</li>
      <li>Black Pepper: 1/2 tablespoon</li>
      <li>Cumin: 1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>Garlic Cloves: 3</li>
      <li>Bouillon Cubes: 3</li>
      <li>Bay Leaves: 5</li>
      <li>Parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
      <li>Frsh Pepper, for garnish: 1</li>
      <li>Small Onion, slices into circles, for garnish: 1</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour the beans in a pot and soak them in water (about 2 inches above
          the beans). Let the beans soak for at least 2-3 hours.</li>
      <li>Drain the water out, pour a new set of water (about 2x the volume of
          the beans), and add a tablespoon of sunflower oil.</li>
      <li> Add four quartered onions, 3-4 dried chili peppers, 3 bouillon cubes,
           5 bay leaves, and 1 tablespoon of red pepper into the water.  Cook the
            beans over medium heat until soft, around 45-60 minutes if you
            previously soaked the beans or around 2 hours if you didn’t.</li>
      <li>Don’t forget to keep checking on the beans, stir often, and keep adding
           warm water as the water evaporates. Aim for stew-like consistency.</li>
      <li>(Optional) If you have the time, turn the fire off and let the beans
          soak in the mix for around an hour. This isn’t a must but it makes
          the beans a lot softer and tastier.</li>
      <li>Drain the beans and take out the leaves.</li>
      <li>Take out the Tava, soak it in sunflower oil and heat it up. Add some red
           pepper (paprika) to the sunflower oil and mix until the oil and paprika
            combine.</li>
      <li>Add finely chopped celery and smashed garlic cloves to the mix and
          preheat your oven to 190°C.</li>
      <li>Pour some tomato sauce and 1 tablespoon of salt to the beans, and mix.
           You should get a light red/ orange color.</li>
      <li> Take some of the water out and pour the beans in the Tava. You’ll want
           to leave just enough water to barely cover the beans. Bake for one hour.</li>
      <li>Add some fresh peppers (cut into half) and place them on top. Push them
           down so they grill up evenly. Increase the heat to 220 °C for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add sliced onions, dried peppers, and chopped parsley on top as garnish.
      Let it cool off for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
