    <hr class="line-separator">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Porl Belly, in slices: 1 1/2 Ibs.</li>
      <li>Potatoes: 2 Ibs</li>
      <li>Butter: 1/3 cup</li>
      <li>Wheat Flour: 3 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Milk: 2 cups</li>
      <li>Parsley, chopped: 2 handfuls</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the potatoes. Peel the potatoes unless you prefer your potatoes with skin. Put them in a
        pot and cover them with water, add salt and put on stove. They need to boil for
        15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare the pork. Dry the slices (they should have a thickness
        of 1/4 in.) and season them with salt and pepper. Then fry them for one minute
         on each side on moderate heat, lower the heat and keep turning the slices
         until they are golden and crispy. Put them on a piece of paper when they are
         done to drain a bit of fat. Keep them hot in your oven while you prepare the
         parsley sauce.</li>
      <li>Prepare the sauce. Melt the butter in a pot. Once it is melted, add the flour
         and stir until the butter and flour is a coherent mass. It shouldn't take long
          and make sure that it doesn't burn so and turn brown. This should be a white
          sauce, with sprinkles of green. Add a little bit of milk and stir. When the
          milk is mixed in and has reached the boiling point, stir for a few seconds and
          then repeat. Add milk stir, boil, stir. Repeat until the sauce has a
          consistency that you like.</li>
      <li>Add the parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
