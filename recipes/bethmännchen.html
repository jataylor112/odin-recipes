    <h2>A popular German marzipan cookie that originates from Frankfurt for the
    Christmas season. Legend has it that its original invator was a chef who cooked for a German
    family of four sons where each almond represented one son. After one of them
    died, three almonds were used instead of four.</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Marzipan: 8 oz.</li>
      <li>Powdered Sugar: 3/4 cup</li>
      <li>Almonds, blanched OR Almond Meal: 3/4 cup</li>
      <li>All-Purpose Flour: 1/3 cup</li>
      <li>Egg White, medium: 1</li>
      <li>Egg Yolk, medium: 1</li>
      <li>Rose Water: 2 teaspoons</li>
      <li>Blanched Whole Almonds, split in half: 3/4 cup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
      <li>Break marzipan into small pieces in a mixing bowl. Sift the powdered sugar
         over the marzipan then add the ground almonds, flour, rose water and egg
         white. Use your hands to combine the ingredients in to a dough.
         The dough will be somewhat sticky but it will get firm after it's sat in the
          fridge. If too sticky, add some more ground almonds and powdered sugar.
      </li>
      <li>Wrap the cookie dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour.</li>
      <li>Roll the dough into small balls, no more than 1-inch in diameter. Sprinkle
         your hands with a little flour or powdered sugar if the dough is too sticky.
          Place the balls on a lined cookie sheet and press 3 almond halves evenly
          around each cookie, pointed side up. Brush each cookie with the egg yolk
          mixture and bake for about 15 minutes until the egg wash turns golden in color.</li>
      <li>Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight
         container for up to several weeks.</li>
    </ol>
