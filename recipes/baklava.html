    <h2>A sweet, syrup-coated pastry filled with chopped nuts! Although its origins
    are murky, it became a popular treat of tradition in the days of the Ottoman Empire
    and would be presented in a sacred procession known as the Baklava Alayi.</h2>
    <hr class="line-separator">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <p class="subheading-ingredient">Baklava</p>
      <li>Walnuts OR other nuts, chopped: 2.5 cups</li>
      <li>Frozen Phyllo Dough, thawed: 1 pack</li>
      <li>Butter, unsalted, melted: 4 oz.</li>
      <li>Ground Cinnamon: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Candied Walnuts OR Pistachios, finely chopped: 1 tablespoon</li>
      <p class="subheading-ingredient">Honey Syrup</p>
      <li>Water: 1 cup</li>
      <li>Sugar: 1 cup</li>
      <li>Honey: 1/2 cup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Baklava. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease baking pan
          with butter or vegetable oil (pan size used in this recipe: 8x8 in).</li>
      <li>Use a pizza cutter to trim phyllo dough to fit your baking pan.</li>
      <li>In a food processor, pulse walnuts or your choice of nuts until finely
           chopped or coarsely ground (based on your personal preference).</li>
      <li>Place 5 sheets of phyllo in the bottom of the baking pan. Brush each
          sheet with melted butter.</li>
      <li>Add 1/2 c of chopped walnuts and spread them evenly on the surface of
           phyllo. Keep the remaining phyllo dough cover by its own plastic wrap
            come with the package or a damp towel to prevent them drying out.</li>
      <li>Add another 2 sheets of phyllo followed by 1/2 c of nuts. Remember to
          brush each phyllo with butter before putting the other one on top.
      Repeat the process until all the chopped nuts are used (approximately 5 to
       6 layers).</li>
      <li>Finish baklava with at least 5 layers (max 10 layers) of phyllo on top.
           The more phyllo you put on top, the crispier baklava will be.</li>
      <li>Use a knife to cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes.</li>
      <li>Bake baklava for 40 to 45 minutes or until the top turns golden brown.</li>
      <li>Prepare the honey syrup. While waiting for baklava to bake, in a small
           saucepan combine water and sugar. Simmer the mixture until sugar
           dissolved completely.</li>
      <li>Add honey, continue simmering the mixture for another 5 minutes. Turn
          off the heat and let it cool down to room temperature. Set aside for
          later use.</li>
      <li>When the baklava is done cooking, take it out from the oven and immediately
           pour the room-temperature honey syrup on top of the baklava.</li>
      <li>There'll be a sizzling sound. Let the baklava sit at room temperature
           and soak in the honey syrup, for at least 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Garnish baklava with chopped nuts before serving.</li>
