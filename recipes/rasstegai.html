    as back then! With the shape of a pie "unbuttoned", it contains fish (or other meats)
    onions, and many seasonings. You can also stuff it with vegetables and potatoes!</h2>
    <hr class="line-separator">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <p class="subheading-ingredient">Dough</p>
      <li>Wheat Flour: 330g</li>
      <li>Milk: 200 mL</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil: 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Dry Yeast: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Sugar: 1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>Salt: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <p class="subheading-ingredient">Filling</p>
      <li>Salmon, Trout, OR Humpback Salmon: 450 g</li>
      <li>Onions: 2</li>
      <li>Oil, for frying</li>
      <li>Salt, for seasoning</li>
      <li>Ground Pepper, for seasoning</li>
      <li>Egg, for smearing: 1 or more</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the dough. Mix together flour, eggs and water or milk and
          knead into a dough, softer than noodle dough. Knead until the dough
          becomes smooth, elastic, and does not stick to hands and the kneading
          board. If you cut the dough in two, its inside should be thick without
           any holes.</li>
      <li>Then form a round loaf and cover it to prevent it from drying. Let it
          rest for at least half an hour. Then thinly roll the rested dough.</li>
      <li>Add salt and fat (greaves, lard, fried bacon) to the mashed potato.
          Then add fried onions, herbs and spices (marjoram, chives, pepper and
          salt). Well mix together all ingredients and quickly knead into a soft
           mixture. The filling must not be crumbly, therefore you should add fat,
            if necessary. Shape the filling into even balls the size of hazelnuts
             and place them on the dough.</li>
      <li>Place the balls of filling on rolled dough with sufficient space between
           them (one finger apart). Cut the dough between the balls horizontally
            and vertically. Then fold the dough over and press down between the
            balls of filling, forming “ears”.</li>
      <li>In the top of each individual žlikrof make a little hollow, so that
          the dough does not tear. Thus Idrija žlikrofi get their characteristic
           hat shape. Typical Idrija žlikrof size: 3 cm in length and 2 cm in height
            – height is measured at the centre, while the ends are slightly higher.</li>
      <li>Put žlikrofi in boiling salted water, stir and cover. When they float
          to the surface and the water starts boiling again, they are cooked.
          Take them from the hot water and serve immediately.</li>
