    <h2>First appearing in Cajsa Warg's cookbook of 1755, it has since become a
        popular food among the Swedes. Although there's no one true method to
        cooking these meatballs, the national dish often incorporates meat, breadcrumbs,
        and dairy to ensure a delicious meal fit for a Swede!</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <p class="subheading-ingredient">Meatballs</p>
      <li>Fresh White Breadcrumbs: 4 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Milk OR Water: 4 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Pork Mince: 225 g (8 oz)</li>
      <li>Veal or Beef Mince: 225 g (8 oz)</li>
      <li>Onion, grated: 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Egg, lightly beaten: 1</li>
      <li>(Optional) Whole Allspice, crushed: 3</li>
      <li>Butter, for frying: 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>White Pepper, freshly grounded</li>
      <p class="subheading-ingredient">Cream Sauce</p>
      <li>Water, hot: 300 mL (1 1/4 cups)</li>
      <li>Beef Stock Cube: 1/2 - 1</li>
      <li>All-Purpose Flour: 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Milk OR Water: 100 mL (7 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>Soy Sauce: 1/2 - 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Cream: 2-3 tablespoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the meatballs. Put the breadcrumbs in a large bowl and add 4
          tablespoons of milk or water. Leave them to absorb the liquid for
          about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the mince, grated onion, egg, allspice (optional) and seasoning.
          Mix with your hands or a wooden spoon until evenly mixed. Don’t over
          mix or the meatballs will be heavy.</li>
      <li>Take a tablespoon of mixture and roll it until it is nice and round.
          (Rinse your hands in cold water if the mixture is too sticky.) Repeat
          until you have used up all the mixture, by which time you should have
          between 30 and 40 meatballs.</li>
      <li>Heat a tablespoon of butter in a frying pan over a medium high heat
          until the butter stops sizzling. Fry half the meatballs, shaking the
          pan frequently when you first add them. When they are nicely browned,
          turn down the heat and cook for a further 10 minutes. Remove the
          meatballs from the pan and keep warm.</li>
      <li>Add another tablespoon of butter and fry the remaining meatballs in the
           same way as in step 4.</li>
      <li> When the meatballs are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and add
          the warm water and use it to scrap up all the meaty bits in the pan.
          Bring it up to the boil and let it simmer for a minute or two.</li>
      <li>Sieve the mixture into a saucepan, add the stock cube and stir until
          dissolved.</li>
      <li>Mix the flour with the milk or water and stir until dissolved. Pour
          into the saucepan, whisking continuously as you do so. Simmer the sauce
           for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the soy sauce and cream. Heat for another couple of minutes,
          stirring continuously with a wooden spoon. (Use a whisk if you like a
          little foam. If you like lots of bubbles, use an
          immersion blender with the blade half in and half out of the sauce.)
          Taste and adjust the seasoning.</li>
      <li>Serve the meatballs with rårörda lingon, mashed potatoes, pressed cucumber
           and a light coating of the sauce. Pour the rest of the cream sauce into
            a jug for people to help themselves to if they want more.</li>
