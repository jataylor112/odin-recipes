    <h2>A Hungarian cake named after Prince Paul III Anton Esterházy de Galántha
    (quite a mouthful!) of the Austrian Empire. It uses buttercream with several
    layers of almond dough then glazed with sugar and decorated in a chocolate
    spiderweb-like pattern.</h2>

      <li>Chocolate, melted: 1/8 cup (22 g)</li>

      <li>Almond Slices: 1 cup (100 g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with the custard: Combine yolks, cornstarch, and ⅜ cup of milk in a
        bowl and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Bring ½ cup of milk and the sugar over medium heat to a boil until the
        sugar is completely dissolved. Stir constantly. Slowly pour hot milk into the
         egg mixture. Stir to combine. Return to the saucepan and cook until thick for
          about 2 minutes. Stir continuously. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.
          Cover with plastic wrap to prevent it from forming a skin. Chill 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Make the meringue layers: With a pencil, draw five 9 in. (23 cm) circles
         on parchment paper. Then turn the parchment paper upside down and place on
          baking sheets. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
      <li>Combine nuts and flour and stir to combine. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl with a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment,
         whisk egg whites and salt on medium-high speed until soft peaks form.</li>
      <li>Add sugar and whisk until glossy and stiff peaks form. Fold in dry ingredients
        carefully. Equally spread the batter into the drawn circles. Make sure that
        they are all the same in size and thickness. Bake one layer at the time for
        10-12 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and immediately flip over the parchment paper and remove
         the paper. Cut the edges evenly that all layers have an even round 9“ shape,
         if necessary. Let cool to room temperature. </li>
      <li>In a large bowl beat butter on medium-high speed until creamy. Add custard
         little by little and stir to combine. Add kirsch and vanilla and stir until
          fully combined and creamy.</li>
      <li>Combine apricot jam and rum in a bowl and stir until smooth and combined.
         Set aside.</li>
      <li>Assemble the cake: Place a 9" spring pan ring on a cake board or cake stand.
         Place the first meringue layer inside the ring and spread with 1/4 of the
         custard buttercream filling. Repeat until you end up with 5 meringue and 4
         cream layers. Finish with the most beautiful meringue layer on top, smooth
         side up. Spread apricot jam on top evenly. Chill for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Place melted chocolate in a zip-lock bag and cut off a tiny edge of the bag.
         The chocolate line what we later draw on top of the cake should be
         0.04 inches (1mm) thick. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Make the glaze: Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup and stir to combine
        until smooth. Microwave a few seconds until it reaches a temperature of 80-85°F
         (26-29°C). Immediately pour on top of chilled Esterhazy Torte. If the glaze
         is too runny, let stand for a few minutes. If it is too thick, microwave a few
          more seconds. Let drip over any excess over the sides.</li>
      <li>Pipe a chocolate wheel on top beginning from the center to the edges.
        Alternately run the tip of a toothpick from the center to the edges and from
         the edges to the center, 1 inch apart. You will have about 8-9 lines in each
         direction. Cover sides with sliced almonds by pressing them against the sides
         with your hand. Chill in the fridge in an airtight container for 4 hours and
         store leftovers up to 3 days.</li>
