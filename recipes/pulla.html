    <h3>A Finnish sweet bread that uses cardamom and a ton of flour! The bread is
         braided with three or more strips intertwined into each loaf.</h3>
    <hr class="line-separator">
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Milk: 2 cups</li>
      <li>Water, warm (110째F/45째C): 1/2 cup</li>
      <li>Active Dry Yeast: 1 package (0.25 oz)</li>
      <li>White Sugar: 1 cup</li>
      <li>Salt: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Ground Cardamom: 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Eggs, beaten: 5</li>
      <li>All-Purpose Flour: 9 cups</li>
      <li>Butter, melted: 1/2 cup</li>
      <li>White Sugar, to sprinkle: 2 teaspoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from
          heat. Let cool until lukewarm.</li>
      <li>Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in the lukewarm milk, sugar,
           salt, cardamom, 4 eggs, and enough flour to make a batter
           (approximately 2 cups). Beat until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
      <li>Add about 3 cups of the flour and beat well; the dough should be smooth
           and glossy in appearance.</li>
      <li>Add the melted butter or margarine, and stir well. Beat again until
          the dough looks glossy. Stir in the remaining flour until the dough
          is stiff.</li>
      <li>Turn out of bowl onto a floured surface, cover with an inverted mixing
           bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes. Knead the dough until smooth and satiny.</li>
      <li>Place in a lightly greased mixing bowl, and turn the dough to grease
          the top. Cover with a clean dishtowel. Let rise in a warm place until
          doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down, and let rise again until
          almost doubled.</li>
      <li>Turn out again on to a floured surface, and divide into 3 parts.
          Divide each third into 3 again. Roll each piece into a 12 to 16 inch
          strip. Braid 3 strips into a loaf. You should get 3 large braided loaves.
           Lift the braids onto greased baking sheets. Let rise for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Brush each loaf with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
      <li>Bake at 400째F (205째C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Check occasionally because
           the bottom burns easily.</li>
    </ol>
